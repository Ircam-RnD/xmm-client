# xmm-client
### XMM models decoders for the browser

This library is intended to be used with the
[original XMM library](https://github.com/julesfrancoise/xmm), or its node wrapper
[xmm-node](https://github.com/Ircam-RnD/xmm-node), which take care of organizing phrases
into training sets and use them for training statistical models.

It contains 3 classes :
- PhraseMaker, which eases the creation of XMM-compatible phrases
(e.g. time series recordings of dimension n), that can then be passed to XMM.
- GmmDecoder, which takes a GMM model generated by XMM and outputs
some estimation results when it's fed with an input vector
- HhmmDecoder, which does the same with a Hierarchical HMM model generated by XMM.

#### installation :

`npm install [--save] Ircam-RnD/xmm-client`

#### example :

```JavaScript
// es6 :
import { PhraseMaker, HhmmDecoder } from 'xmm-client';
const phraseMaker = new PhraseMaker({
	column_names: ['gyrAlpha', 'gyrBeta', 'gyrGamma'],
	label: 'someGesture'
});
const hhmmDecoder = new HhmmDecoder();

// older es versions :
var xmmClient = require('xmm-client');
var phraseMaker = new xmmClient.PhraseMaker({
	column_names: ['gyrAlpha', 'gyrBeta', 'gyrGamma'],
	label: 'someGesture'
});
var hhmmDecoder = new xmmClient.HhmmDecoder();
```

#### note :

xmm-client is still a work in progress.
